Due to the fast-paced nature of the modern world, cities have been getting more congested every year thus adding to the strain on city infrastructure like roads. 

To solve this problem of traffic we are trying to build a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning **(MARL)** system for managing dynamic, complicated traffic. The main advantage of the MARL system is that it can walk the fine line between global optimizing the traffic flow and ensuring that traffic is not being choked at any intersection

#### Problem 
Create a scalable, efficient traffic control system capable of handling real-world dynamic traffic networks using Reinforcement Learning technique

#### Project Details
Project Working
*  Cameras/sensors placed on the road near the intersection find out the vehicle queue length and the time taken for the queue to move
* Each intersection in the network contains an individual agent. Each agent is given the role of optimizing the traffic at its own incoming and outgoing lanes , i.e. locally.
* To improve the traffic globally and to react fast to events in different places, each agent talks to each other by passing in the last states.
* These last state information are discounted to control their effect.
