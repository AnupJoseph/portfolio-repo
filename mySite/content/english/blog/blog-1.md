> On 25-March-2020, India went into a lockdown of historically unprecedented proportions. The energy sector felt the sting of the lockdown with a year-on-year total power consumption [decline of 23.2% in April](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-s-power-consumption-up-13-38-in-oct-as-industrial-activity-revives-120110100354_1.html) throughout India.

On 5-April-2020 India held a 9-minute blackout at 9 PM alongside a candle-light vigil to express a collective will to fight the pandemic. This event was a testament to how power operators across the country can manage sharp changes in demand by utilizing various resources, including [hydro, gas, thermal flexibly](https://posoco.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Report-on-Pan-India-Lights-Off-Event-9-PM-9-Minutes-on-5th-April-2020-1.pdf) in the country.

On 21-March-2020, the power consumption of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Company Limited (TANGEDCO) stood at 349.9 MU (Figure-1). However, as the Janata curfew set in and the lockdown came into full force, electricity consumption steadily declined to 273.6 MU on 26-March to a low of 210.7 MU on 11-April. This represents a 40% reduction from March to April in 2020.

In Tamil Nadu, the lockdown resulted in the closure of all major industrial units and commercial spaces, which are the primary consumers of electricity. The agriculture sector provided some solace with the [onset of the sowing season](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadus-electricity-demand-fell-148-in-may-but-rebounded-slightly-from-april/article31960852.ece). The other actual uptick in electricity demand came from the [residential sector](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-lockdown-increases-domestic-power-usage-by-15-2129883.html) as people started working from home, and possibly due to increased temperature levels necessitating [the use of air conditioners](https://www.prayaspune.org/peg/blogs/household-electricity-consumption-in-india-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-insights-from-metering-data.html).
