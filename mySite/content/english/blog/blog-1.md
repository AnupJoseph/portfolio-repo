On 25-March-2020, India went into a lockdown of historically unprecedented proportions. The energy sector felt the sting of the lockdown with a year-on-year total power consumption [decline of 23.2% in April](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-s-power-consumption-up-13-38-in-oct-as-industrial-activity-revives-120110100354_1.html) throughout India.

On 5-April-2020 India held a 9-minute blackout at 9 PM alongside a candle-light vigil to express a collective will to fight the pandemic. This event was a testament to how power operators across the country can manage sharp changes in demand by utilizing various resources, including [hydro, gas, thermal flexibly](https://posoco.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Report-on-Pan-India-Lights-Off-Event-9-PM-9-Minutes-on-5th-April-2020-1.pdf) in the country. Among these national stories, electricity consumption patterns in Tamil Nadu paint a fascinating commentary that has gone largely unnoticed.
